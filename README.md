## Welcome to the mauth!

This is simply a demo project to integrate the multi-auth feature using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).

Nothing fancy here. To get started simply clone the project and hit the command below:

`composer install`

Set up the **APP_KEY** by the following command if it is not there in your **.env**

`php artisan key:generate`

Set up the database name and user and password(if any) and hit the command below:

`php artisan migrate`

You're all set. Hit the command below to serve the application

`php artisan serve`
